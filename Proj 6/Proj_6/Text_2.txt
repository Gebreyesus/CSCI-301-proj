Design, implement, test, and document a C++ program that reads an input file of text and builds a concordance of the words in the file, as in Projects 4 and 6. The program will also report the number of distinct words in the file. The concordance will be represented by an ordered list in which words determine order and counts accompany each word. A pointer-based binary search tree will implement the list: each node of the tree will contain a word and its count. Words will be ordered alphabetically, disregarding capitalization. Implement this structure in a class.
